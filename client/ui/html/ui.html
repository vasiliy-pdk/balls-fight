    <p><b>About multiplayer:</b></p>

    <p>There is one Master player. His browser gets input from the server, processes it and send serialized scene data back.
      Not scene is serialized, but only specified entities.
      Others are Slaves. Their browsers just send input to the Master and render gotten scene.
      Server ( Node.js ) is just a proxy for input and scene data. It also controls who will be a Master, and switches the
      role to another player if master is disconnected.
    </p>

    <p><i>Why have I decided to go in that way?</i></p>

    <p>
      This way is very easy to implement. You don't have to double game logic on the server side. You just have to specify
      what do you want to sync and how often. That's it.

      But it has drawbacks in the current state. It's more affected by network delays because data between Master and Slave should travel one
      more extra node.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next serious step is to make Playcanvas available to run right on the server without graphics. It will be the Master. It will
      process all game logic and physics. And there will be the same codebase.

    <p>You should hit with your ball to the blue target. If you push away your opponent from the ring you will get extra score.
      If you fall from the ring, you loose your score.

    <p>Use arrows to control your ball.</p>
